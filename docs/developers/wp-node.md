# WordPress Profile Plugin

The WordPress Profile Plugin is currently a beta release available for download at our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MurmurationsNetwork/MurmurationsNodeWP/releases). We are releasing it as a beta to get wider testing before we make it available in the [WordPress Plugins directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/).

To setup the beta plugin on your WordPress site:

1. Download the latest [plugin installer file](https://github.com/MurmurationsNetwork/MurmurationsNodeWP/releases) (click the dropdown arrow next to 'Assets' for the latest release and select the .zip file)
2. Login to the Admin pages of your WordPress site and select the Plugins menu item
3. Click on "Add New" and then "Upload Plugin"
4. Select the file you downloaded in Step 1 above, then click "Install Now"
5. Once installed, click on "Activate Plugin"
6. Finally, click on the "Murm-Profiles" menu item
7. Start publishing profiles to the Murmurations network!

## Important notes

- If you have an earlier (pre 1.0.0) version of the plugin installed, you must deactivate and uninstall it first before installing the current version, which is a major update so the old data will be incompatible with this new release.
- If you have any issues installing or using the plugin, please [contact us](/about/getting-support.html).
