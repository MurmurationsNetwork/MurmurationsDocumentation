# WordPress Profile Generator Plugin

## Overview

The Murmurations Profile Generator WordPress Plugin is a quick and simple way to publish [profiles](/about/common-terms.html#profile) about an organization, project, person or offered and wanted goods and services to the Murmurations network. Just select an environment ([test or production](/developers/environments.html)) and a [schema](/about/common-terms.html#schema), fill in the form and then post it to Murmurations. Your WordPress site will host the profiles and submit them to the Murmurations index, where they can be discovered by [aggregators](/about/common-terms.html#aggregator).

[See the example screenshots showing a profile being created](https://github.com/MurmurationsNetwork/MurmurationsNodeWP/blob/main/README.md#screenshots)

## Installation

::: danger Older plugin versions
If you have an earlier (pre 1.0.0) version of the plugin installed, you must deactivate and uninstall it first before installing the current version. The current 1.0.0 version is a major update so the old data will be incompatible with this new release.
:::

::: warning WP/PHP requirements
You need to be running the latest version of WordPress (version 6.4 or higher) and PHP 8. The plugin is not backwards compatible with older versions of WordPress or PHP.
:::
