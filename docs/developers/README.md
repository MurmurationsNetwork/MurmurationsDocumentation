## Development URLs

### Staging

The test URLs have been set up to provide a space for developers to test their schemas before submitting data to the live Index.

Currently we are using the test URLs to run version 2 of the Murmurations protocol.

- Index - [https://test-index.murmurations.network/v2/nodes](https://test-index.murmurations.network/v2/nodes)
- Library - [https://test-library.murmurations.network/v1/schemas](https://test-library.murmurations.network/v1/schemas)
- CDN - [https://test-cdn.murmurations.network](https://test-cdn.murmurations.network)
- Profile Generator - [https://mpgv2.murmurations.network](https://mpgv2.murmurations.network)
- Demo Map Aggregator - [https://murmdemo.dreamhosters.com/map](https://murmdemo.dreamhosters.com/map)

### Production

The production environment is operating version 1 of the protocol.

We are aiming to put V2 into production during Q3 2022, at which point V1 will be deprecated, so **use our test environment** to experiment with the latest version of the Murmurations protocol.
