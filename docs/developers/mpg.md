# Murmurations Profile Generator

MPG is used to generate and post profiles to networks you want to be a part of. Select the network schema you want, enter the requested data and your profile is instantly posted to MPG's database and the [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) network.

> :warning: All information you post to Murmurations is stored on an open network. Do not publish anything that you would not want accessible to (potentially) the whole world.

MPG will store your profiles for you if you do not have the means to store them yourself, potentially on your own website. Or you can just copy and paste the generated JSON into a `.json` file on your website.
