# Murmurations Profile Generator

[MPG](https://main-profiles.murmurations.network) is used to generate and post profiles to networks you want to be a part of. Just create an account, select the network schema you want, enter the requested data and your profile is instantly posted to MPG's database and the [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) network.

> :warning: All information you post to Murmurations is stored on an open network. Do not publish anything that you would not want to make available to (potentially) the whole world.

MPG will store and publish your profiles for you if you do not have the means to do so yourself. Or you can just copy and paste the generated JSON into a `.json` file to post on your website, and then submit your profile to the Index.
