## Test Environment

The `test-` URLs have been set up to provide a space for developers to test their schemas before submitting them to the production Library, and profiles to the production Index.

## Production Environment

Once you have tested things out in our test environment and you are ready to put real data in Murmurations, use the production URLs below.

Please note that only the Schemas approved by the Murmurations core team for production use are available through the Library API and repo.
