# Contributing

Would you like to contribute to Murmurations? Great! Here are three things you can help with:

If you have experience with interoperable data, especially around mapping initiatives, your perspective would be useful in our technical advisory group. Please send a message to adam@photosynthesis.ca to find out about joining our crew of advisors.

If you have JS programming experience, send us a message about helping build out React-based interfaces and other portable interface components for Murmurations data. This is an interesting design and programming challenge, and we'd love to have your assistance (there is also funding available for some of this work).

If you have PHP and Wordpress programming experience, you could help out with our Aggregator and Node WP plugins. Although Wordpress is often not the most exciting ecosystem to be working in, we're tackling some interesting data abstraction problems with these plugins, so there are some technical questions that go beyond the Wordpress norm. Fun stuff! :)

If you know Golang (especially if this knowledge also touches Kubernetes, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch), we need you on our Murmurations Services team. This is the core architecture of Murmurations, and we're building it with performance and scale in mind. Send a message to Geoff for more details.

Finally, if you're a data geek and have experience with ontologies and vocabularies, and are also open minded about the pragmatic context of Murmurations, we're looking for you for our library review team. This still-nascent group is responsible for reviewing field and schema submissions and nudging the Murmruations ecosystem toward increasingly sound, reliable, and interoperable data standards. We need your help! Message Oli for details.
