# Introduction: What is Murmurations?


Murmurations is a distributed data sharing network built to help connect new economy
projects and organisations and make them visible to the world and each other.

The network is made up of three kinds of things:

- Nodes and other *data hosts* that share data into the network

- An *index* that keeps track of what data is available in the network, and where

- *Aggregators* that collect data from the network and display it in various ways

- A *library* of fields and schemas that describe the data in the network

To make these entities work, Murmurations provides:

- A protocol for defining and exchanging data about and among organizations, based on existing standards such as JSON-Schema, schema.org, REST, and JSON-LD principles.

- A demo aggregator and a user-friendly data host where organizations can quickly add themselves to the network.

- Open-source plugins and other code to make it as easy as possible to use, share, and contribute data to the network in a decentralized way.

The initial use case for Murmurations is to facilitate decentralized mapping of purpose-driven and solidarity economy organizations and projects.
