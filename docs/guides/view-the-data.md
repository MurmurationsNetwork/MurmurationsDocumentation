The [Murmurations Map](https://map.murmurations.network/) allows you to explore all of the Nodes in Murmurations that have geolocation coordinates associated with them.

## Using the API

The [Index API](/developers/index-api.md) enables you to programmatically fetch data using the [`GET /nodes`](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/MurmurationsNetwork/IndexAPI/2.0.0#/Aggregator%20Endpoints/get_nodes) endpoint. The search and filtering options are the same as with the MPG search page described above.
