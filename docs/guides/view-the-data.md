# View Murmurations Data

## Search in MPG

The [Profile Generator](../about/common-terms.md#profile-generator) has a [search page](https://profiles.murmurations.network/get-nodes) that enables you to search for [Nodes](/docs/about/common-terms.md) in the Murmurations network based a variety of search criteria such as:
- Schema name
- User-defined tags
- Website address

## View the Map

:construction: Work In Progress :construction:

We are currently building a map that will enable you to view any of the Nodes in the Murmurations network.

**Estimated time of completion: January 2023**

## Using the API

The [Index API](/developers/index-api.md) enables you to programmatically fetch data using the [`GET /nodes`](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/MurmurationsNetwork/IndexAPI/2.0.0#/Aggregator%20Endpoints/get_nodes) endpoint. The search and filtering options are the same as with the MPG search page described above.
