## Search in MPG

There is a [search page](https://tools.murmurations.network/index-explorer) that enables you to search for [Nodes](/docs/about/common-terms.md) in the Murmurations network based a variety of search criteria such as:
- Schema name
- User-defined tags
- Website address

## Using the API

The [Index API](/developers/index-api.md) enables you to programmatically fetch data using the [`GET /nodes`](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/MurmurationsNetwork/IndexAPI/2.0.0#/Aggregator%20Endpoints/get_nodes) endpoint. The search and filtering options are the same as with the MPG search page described above.
