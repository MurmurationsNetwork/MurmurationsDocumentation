# Schema FAQs

If you want to create a map or directory using Murmurations based on data which you, or others, will add to the Murmurations Index you first need to create a Murmurations schema. Please read our [guide on creating a schema]([https://docs.murmurations.network/guides/aggregators.html](https://docs.murmurations.network/guides/create-a-schema.html)).

If you have questions you can search and ask in [the Forum](https://murmurations.flarum.cloud/), and if you still have questions [send us a message](https://murmurations.network/contact/) and we will reply and add the answer here, or join the [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/JvotB0kuxrjFgvYszbNvZw) and ask there...
