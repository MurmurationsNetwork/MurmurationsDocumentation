## What is the Murmurations Protocol?

The Murmurations Protocol, which we also just call Murmurations, is a standardised, open source set of rules designed to enable decentrlaised, interoperable, data sharing and aggregation. Murmurations uses existing standards including [JSON-Schema](https://json-schema.org/), [Schema.org](https://schema.org/), and [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) to help people, projects and organisations discover each other and share data across platforms and between networks. The ultimate aim of Murmurations is to accelerate the global transition to the [regenerative economy](https://capitalinstitute.org/8-principles-regenerative-economy/).

## Can you explain the terms you use?

See the [common terms](https://docs.murmurations.network/about/common-terms.html) we use when working with Murmurations.

## How do I create a Murmurations profile?

Visit the [Murmurations Profile Generator](https://main-profiles.murmurations.network/) and follow the steps.

## How can I use Murmurations to create a map or directory or other type of aggregator?

See our [guide for aggregators](https://docs.murmurations.network/guides/aggregators.html)

## Are there any restrictions on what I can do with Murmurations?
